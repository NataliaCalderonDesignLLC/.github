## Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before starting any code changes ensure you're not on `main` branch.

<details>
  <summary>Workflow steps</summary>

Create a branch off of `main` by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <my-branch>
```

> [!TIP]
> Once you have a branch you can push the branch, create a PR and keep making commits. The PR will keep track of all the commits and you can continously save your work without affecting `main`. Push your changes often so that you don't lose your work in the event of an accidental dataloss incident.

Once you're ready to merge your changes into `main` branch go ahead and merge the PR. Once the PR is merged you will need to run the following commands locally:

* **Switch back to main branch**

```bash
git switch main
```

* **Pull latest changes**

```bash
git pull
```

* **Tag your `main` branch with latest version**

```bash
git tag v0.X.X
```

* **Push tags**

```bash
git push --tags
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't forget to cleanup leftover branches that have already been merged

</details>

## Cleanup

To cleanup and/or view any local branches run:

```bash
git branch
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Never delete `main` branch.

```bash
git branch -D <my-branch>
```
